PLANCK CMB Cube Maps
===========================================================================

This repository contains cube maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctations. The original data was taken from the Planck Legacy Archive (http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/aio/planckProducts.html). The cube maps were generated from the smica dataset (COM_CompMap_CMB-smica_2048_R1.20.fits) using a slightly modified version of CMBView (http://code.google.com/p/cmbview/). Then, a python scrtip was used to converted the raw images to a color scheme which approximately matches that used by the Planck team.
